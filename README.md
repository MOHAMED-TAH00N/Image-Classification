# Image-Classification
This project focuses on classifying images into six categories: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street. The goal is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately classify images based on these predefined classes. This task is a common example of supervised machine learning in computer vision.
